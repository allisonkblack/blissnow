# blissnow

Bliss Now is a project I did with a group in my Recommendation Engines class for IE's Master of Business Analytics and Big Data. 
By creating a mock wellness platform with a recommendation engine, we aimed to help everyone who wants to maintain or increase their wellness 
at any time in any place. Through personalized recommendations and cutting-edge algorithm, we are offer users with diverse wellness-related options 
through our intuitive user interface.
